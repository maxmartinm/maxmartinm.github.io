  <h1>Hi, I'm Max! Welcome to my website.</h1>
  <p>I was born and raised in New Haven, CT and am a rising sophomore at Yale University. My perspective major is Biology.</p>
  <p>I got to travel a lot growing up; as a result, traveling has become one of my favorite things to do. I actually studied abroad in Vigo, Spain during my senior year of high school.</p>
  <p>I also play on the varsity squash team at Yale and am a brother of SigEp.</p>
